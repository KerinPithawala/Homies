Project made during HackTheNorth 2020++

During this pandemic it is extremely important to reduce going out to decrease the rate of virus transmission.

App to hold social accountability of not going outside for non-essential purposes by creating social accountability
partners on an app in which users send their friends a folder of embarrassing photos that they will have complete 
access to choose and post on the other userâ€™s account if they break the rule and go outside.

Incentivizes going outside when the store is less busy
Encourages friends to hold each other accountable
Whoever has the most points at the end of the week in an accountability group gets their photo posted
Automatically deleted after 24 hours
If everyone is below an pre-determined level x, everyone is safe
