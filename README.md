# Homies
Stay at home. Compete with friends. Keep neighbourhoods safe.
Project made during HackTheNorth 2020++

During this pandemic, it is extremely important to reduce how often we go out to decrease the rate of transmission.

Homies is an app to hold social accountability of staying at home through accountability "squads". At the beginning of the week, users send in a piece of collateral in the form of an embarrassing photo. Users accumulate demerit points when they leave their home, and the point value for a certain activity is determined based on its associated risk level. The app analyzes locations for popularity and peak times, and will place a larger demerit point value on locations that are more crowded. At the end of the week, the user with the most demerit points in their squad will be subject to having their embarrassing photo posted automatically to their social media page for 24 hours.

The gamification of the stay at home order encourages friends to hold each other accountable in keeping our communities safe.
